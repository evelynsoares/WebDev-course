<h3>The Handmaiden</h3>
<h4>by Park Chan-Wook</h4>
<p>This movie tells a beautiful and interesting story of two very powerful women in 30s Korea, each of them coming from very different backgrounds.<br>
It evolves into bombastic plot twists *eyes emoji* and it is beautifully shoot.</p>

<p>It feels like it is all emotions together in one single movie. <br>
  While also being most scientificlly accurate.</p>
<h3>Kill Bill: Vol. 1</h3>
<h4>by Quentin Tarantino</h4>
<p>brbrbrbr go crazy rvvrvrbrbrab go stupid.
